    <p>Please read the following before using the site:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Barabooru reserves the right to delete or modify your account, or any content you have posted to the site.</li>

      <li>You have read the <%= link_to "tagging guidelines", wiki_pages_path(:title => "help:tags") %>.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h6>Post/Comment Limiting</h6>
      <p>You cannot upload a post or comment during the first minute of signing up.</p>
      <p>After the initial period, you can post up to ten comments an hour and a variable number of posts based on how many of your previous uploads were approved or deleted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h6>Prohibited and Restricted Content</h6>
      <p>You may not upload any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Non-anime: Photographs of American porn actresses, for example, are prohibited. Photographs of cosplayers, figures, or prominent figures in the industry are acceptable.</li>
        <li>Manga: Uploading entire manga or doujinshi chapters is discouraged. Individual pages can be uploaded if they meet the quality criterion.</li>
        <li>Fake translations: Images that have false translations are not allowed in any case.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>The following may be uploaded, but will be put to a higher level of artistic and qualitative scrutiny than normal, and you absolutely must tag them with the corresponding tag:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grotesque: Any depiction of extreme mutilation, extreme bodily distension, feces, or bodies that are far outside the realm of normal human proportion (for example, breasts that are larger than three heads in size or penises that are larger than two heads in size).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following may be uploaded but are generally not recommended unless a better copy cannot be found:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Third-Party Watermark: Any image where a person who is not the original copyright owner has placed a watermark on the image.</li>
        <li>Hard translations: Images that have been edited to replace the original language are discouraged.</li>
        <li>Poorly compressed: Any image where compression artifacts are easily visible.</li>
        <li>Nude Filter: Images that have been edited by someone other than the original creator to remove clothing or censorship. These typically feature crude drawings of breasts or genitalia laid on top of the original image.</li>
      </ul>
